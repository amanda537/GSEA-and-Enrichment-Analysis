# GSEA-and-Enrichment-Analysis
I developed a web application during my 2023 internship at Van Andel Institute, this application does GSEA and enrichment analysis.
## Application Details
In this application, users can download a mouse gene file to test out the analysis. Users can select a species( Mus musculus or Homo sapiens), 
a gene collection (H, C1-C8), and a type of analysis (Over-Presentation Analysis or Gene Set Enrichment Analysis).

Users can also download the file and the image after each analysis.

This application is not fully developed, so sometimes the application server does time out. 

I have the code in the text file, feel free to look at uiR.txt and serverR.txt and develop further.
